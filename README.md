# Astro Landing Page for PickPackShipCalc App

## Sales Copy Shoutout

### Pain

* HEADLINE: Is my shop profitable today???
* Have you ever had a streak of net negative days without recognizing it?
* Tired of not being able to have your daily numbers available without manual effort?
* Wasting time every day manually calculating your picking, packing, and shipping costs for every order?
* Are you throwing away money, by not identifying low and top-performing products due to missing order costs in your daily numbers?

### Dream

* Zero effort, complete daily numbers without breaking the bank
* Every order's cost down to the penny or cent?
* Fully automated, even on the lower Shopify plans with limited analytics options!
* Your daily Shopify business numbers, are just one click away, no matter where you are!

### Solution

* Copy and adopt our template for Make.com to get every Shopify order data into your own Google Sheet for nearly free of charge
* PickPackShipCalc lets you claculate - you guessed it - picking, packing, and shipping costs for every order based on:
  * lookup tables for costs, based on the number of line items
  * free formulas based on product/variant tags
  * more yet-to-be-found ways
* 

## TODOs

### Public Static Content

* favicon
* social OG image (just a screenshot of the above the fold? or more feature/solution oriented?)
* social description in index.astro
* OG tags in index.astro

### Page

* remove GitHub corner
* Image of Shopify Bag with a $, an â‚¬ sign, and a pulsating question mark. SVG?
